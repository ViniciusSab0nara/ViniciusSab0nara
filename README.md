## 👨‍💻 Aspiring Data Analyst 

I'm an aspiring **Data Professional**, currently focused on learning SQL and deepening my knowledge in data analysis and database management.

My journey with technology began during high school, where I had my first contact with code and developed a passion for solving problems through data. Since then, I've worked with systems, participated in social and leadership projects, and recently decided to dedicate three focused months to building a solid foundation in SQL, practicing daily through real exercises and documentation.

This repository is part of that journey — a place to track progress, organize studies, and build a portfolio aligned with a future career in data.

## 🧠 My Focus: Data & SQL Foundations

Currently, I'm fully dedicated to my studies, pursuing a self-taught journey with a strong focus on SQL and data analysis. I'm building a solid foundation for a future in the data field — from relational databases and query logic to real-world practice and portfolio development.

I believe in cultivating a broad, hands-on understanding of technology, which is why I also explore tools and routines that support productivity and continuous learning. I like to think of it as assembling my own data analyst's 'utility belt'. 🧰📊

## 🌱 Beyond the Code

Beyond my technical studies, I've been actively involved in purpose-driven projects that connect technology, leadership, and community. One example is my role in the Haevete project, where I help lead initiatives focused on culture, spirituality, and human development.

These experiences have strengthened not only my analytical thinking and problem-solving, but also key **soft skills** like communication, empathy, and team leadership — all of which I consider essential for a modern data professional.

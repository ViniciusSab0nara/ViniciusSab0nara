<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm VinÃ­cius Sabonara</h1>

<h2 align="center">Aspiring Data Analyst & Tech Leader</h2>

<p align="center">
  I'm an aspiring <b>Data Professional</b>, currently focused on learning SQL and deepening my knowledge in data analysis and database management.<br>
  My journey with technology began during high school, where I had my first contact with code and developed a passion for solving problems through data. Since then, I've worked with systems, participated in social and leadership projects, and recently decided to dedicate three focused months to building a solid foundation in SQL, practicing daily through real exercises and documentation.<br>
  This repository is part of that journey â€” a place to track progress, organize studies, and build a portfolio aligned with a future career in data.

<h2 align="center">ðŸ§  My Focus: Data & SQL Foundations</h2>

<p align="center">
  Currently, I'm fully dedicated to my studies, pursuing a self-taught journey with a strong focus on SQL and data analysis.<br>
  I'm building a solid foundation for a future in the data field â€” from relational databases and query logic to real-world practice and portfolio development.<br>
  I believe in cultivating a broad, hands-on understanding of technology, which is why I also explore tools and routines that support productivity and continuous learning. I like to think of it as assembling my own data analyst's 'utility belt'. ðŸ§°ðŸ“Š

<h2 align="center">ðŸŒ± Beyond the Code</h2>

<p align="center">
  Beyond my technical studies, I've been actively involved in purpose-driven projects that connect technology, leadership, and community.<br>
  One example is my role in the Haevete project, where I help lead initiatives focused on culture, spirituality, and human development.<br>
  These experiences have strengthened not only my analytical thinking and problem-solving, but also key <b>soft skills</b> like communication, empathy, and team leadership â€” all of which I consider essential for a modern data professional.
